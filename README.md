<h1>Coding suggestions:</h1>
<P>For login page:<Br>
Accept user email address and password.
Search for both items within the database. If they don't BOTH match, and error message will pop up saying something to the effect of,
"Incorrect login information provided."</p>

<p>For password help, the user will be asked to enter their email address to reset their password.</p>

<P>Log out page:<br>
A static page that simply has a goodbye message to the user.</p>
